THE AMERICAN MIND.

FOURTH OF JULY ORATION, 1923.

BY REV. CHARLES W. LYONS, S. J.


In the evolution of any life, whether it be that of an individual or
of that corporate moral union we know as society, there are times
when it seems fitting and proper to pause from the whirl of incessant
activities, turn aside from accustomed line of thought, and let the
mind run sweetly and lovingly over a treasured past.

And today our beloved country, in the fulness of her achievement, with
the memories of one hundred and forty-seven years, one hundred and
forty-seven golden years, lived only that her children might grow,
as from eternity the Creator had destined them to grow, in the full
security of rights that are inalienable.

Today our beloved country turns to us children of a later generation
and pleads that we follow this generous impulse of nature, and tarry
for the moment, while she lives over again the thoughts and emotions
and heroic sacrifices that gave her birth.

They were not new thoughts or unknown emotions. As John Quincy Adams
so well remarked in his scholarly discourse on the Jubilee of the
Constitution: “The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of
the United States are parts of one constant whole, founded upon one
and the same theory of government, then new not as a theory, for it
had been working itself into the mind of man for many ages, but it had
never before been adopted by a great nation.”

Moses, as narrated in Deuteronomy, had charged the judges in Israel:
“There shall be no difference of persons; you shall hear the little as
well as the great; neither shall you respect any man’s person, because
it is the judgment of God.”

Aristotle had taught that, “the State is not merely an institution for
repressing vice, but a necessary formation for the full development of
humanity.”

In the Magna Charter the germ of true liberty and equality is seen in
the pledges of the king to his people: “We will not set forth against
any freeman, nor send against him, unless by the lawful judgment of his
peers and by the law of the land; to no one will we sell, to no one
will we refuse or delay right or justice.”

The mediæval councils, the military orders, the guilds, followed
centuries after by the contract of the Pilgrim Fathers made in the
cabin of the “Mayflower” in which they “covenanted and combined
themselves into a civil body politic for their better order and
preservation,” as well as the charters of the Providence Plantations,
of Virginia, and of Maryland, had accustomed the people to joint action
of mutual compact and deliberate agreement in defense of liberty and
justice which, after all, is the mother of democracy.

While the schoolmen, with scarcely an exception, as Sidwick tells us,
taught that, “governments derive their just powers from the consent of
the governed.”

“Every constitution,” says Nicholas of Cusa, three and a half centuries
before the Declaration of Independence, “is rooted in natural law and
cannot be valid if it contradicts it.”

“Since all are free by nature,” he continues, “all government, whether
by written law or a prince, is based solely on the agreement and
consent of the subject. For if by nature men are equally powerful and
free, true and ordered power in the hands of one can be established
only by the election and consent of the others, just as law also is
established by consent.”

“It is clear, therefore,” he adds, “that the binding validity of all
constitutions is based on tacit and expressed agreement and consent.”

And although Elizabeth had asserted in 1585 that “kings and princes
sovereign owe their homage and service only to Almighty God,” and James
defended the Divine Right of Kings, and the University of Cambridge,
in its address to Charles II, had declared that they believed and
maintained that “our kings derive not their title from the people
but from God,” “Defenders of Liberty” were not wanting, Bellarmine
declaring boldly, as Sir Robert Filmer tells us, that “secular or civil
power is instituted by men; it is in the people unless they bestow it
on a prince. This power is immediately in the whole multitude as in
the subject of it. For this power is in the Divine Law, but the Divine
Law hath given this power to no particular men; if the positive law be
taken away, there is left no reason why amongst a multitude (who are
equal) one rather than another should bear rule over the rest. Power is
given by the multitude to one man or to more by the same law of nature;
for the commonwealth cannot exercise this power, therefore it is bound
to bestow it upon some one man or some few. It depends upon the consent
of the multitude to ordain over themselves a king or consul or other
magistrates. And if there be a lawful cause, the multitude may change
the kingdom into an aristocracy or democracy.”

These thoughts and emotions, expressed and re-expressed by the writers,
philosophers and political leaders of their day, had seeped down
through the ages unactuated, mere themes for academic speculation,
until they filtered into the minds and souls of those simple, yet truly
great men, who, in signing the Declaration of Independence, gave birth
to the nation we so rightfully cherish and so lovingly serve.

In a letter to his friend Henry Lee, dated May 8, 1825, Jefferson, as
if in confirmation of what we have just held, notes that the object of
the Declaration of Independence was “not to find out new principles,
or new arguments, never before thought of, not merely to say things
which had never before been said; but to place before mankind the
common sense of the subject in terms so plain and firm as to command
their assent and to justify ourselves in the independent stand we
are compelled to take. Neither aiming at originality of principle or
sentiment, nor yet copied from any particular or previous writing, it
was intended to be an expression of the _American mind_, and to give to
that expression the proper tone and spirit called for by the occasion.
All its authority rests then on the harmonizing sentiments of the day,
whether expressed in conversation, in letters, printed essays, or in
the elementary books of public right, as Aristotle, Cicero, Locke,
Sidney, etc.”

What, then, was this American mind, that, amid problems vexed and
theories varied, had sifted the wisdom and folly of the past,
discerning the true from the false, the good from the evil, and “of
which,” Jefferson was pleased to say, “the Declaration of Independence
was intended to be an expression?” And what, again, was “the proper
tone and spirit called for by the occasion” that the Declaration of
Independence was to give to this expression of the American mind?

If we look more closely at the type of men whose united action founded
our nation the answer to this question will not be far to seek. They,
like many of us here today, were either immigrants or the immediate
descendants of immigrants. They differed in origin, in education,
in race, and in creed. They had the traditions, the affections, the
prejudices of their times and of their peoples. Yet in common they
had left home and country, led on by a vision or an ideal that made a
fitting basis for the union that was to come. They would break away
from an effete civilization; they would start life anew, freed from the
tyranny of unjust laws; they would enjoy liberty to worship their God
according to the dictates of their own conscience; they would exercise,
without unwarranted interference, their natural and inalienable right
to the pursuit of happiness.

Crossing, as they did, the same unknown seas, buffeted by the
same winds and waves, coming to the same uncultivated, though not
inhospitable shores, their difficulties, their interests, their common
foe, drew them together in mutual helpfulness, in united enterprise,
and in common defense.

Thus they came to know one another; thus they learned to bear with
one another; thus they grew to love one another; and understanding,
and tolerance, and brotherly love developed the American mind. So
that, when the occasion arose, in proper tone and spirit, it expressed
itself in the immortal Declaration of Independence that solved the
speculative problems of the past, secured full enjoyment of liberty for
its people, and gave hope and inspiration to all mankind and for all
time.

And shall we mar the beauty of her gift? Shall we, forgetting our
common interests, our common enterprises, our common foes, destroy the
unity of purpose and of action that is essential for individual and
national prosperity? Shall we, by misunderstanding, by intolerance
and hatred, sully the luster of our heritage, breaking the bondage of
brotherhood?

Ours is a most responsible trust. We must hand it down to posterity
sacred and intact. Capital must make truce with labor; labor must make
pact with capital; each must measure even in the scales of justice. The
rights--inalienable rights--of man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness, must not be infringed. The rights--natural and civic
rights--of property must not be denied. Class prejudices, racial pride,
assumed superiority, must be dislodged from the minds of men, that
justice may function and equality and the dignity of human nature be
sustained.

The home must be safeguarded, and its sanctity preserved, that our
children be protected and grow--as nature destined them to grow--in
wisdom and grace before God and man.

The school--the private and the public school--free as speech and the
press are free--must be encouraged that our citizens may understand
the Constitution and our laws, and in the full development of their
intellectual faculties realize the burdens as well as the privileges of
representative government.

The church, the House of God, must have its place of respect, that our
children may continue moral and grow in reverence for authority and for
the divine and human law.

As Hamilton wrote to Washington, on the occasion of his farewell
address: “In all those dispositions which promote political happiness,
religion and morality are essential props.”

This, I take it, is the message our beloved country would send to us
today. That we be men of _American mind_, the mind that expressed
itself in the Declaration of Independence, the mind that was born of
understanding, tolerance, and brotherly love, the mind that didn’t
hesitate to say, in the closing words of the great document that gave
to us our nation, “For the support of this declaration, with a firm
reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to
each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.”

[10] Passed through three editions in Boston and one in London, and was
answered in a pamphlet, Remarks upon an Oration delivered by Charles

Letters of Charles Sumner, by Edward L. Pierce, vol. ii. 337-384.

[11] There is a second edition. (Boston: Ticknor, Reed & Fields. 1850.
49 pp. 12^o.)

[12] First published by the City in 1892.

[13] This and a number of the succeeding orations, up to 1861, contain
the speeches, toasts etc., of the City dinner usually given in Faneuil
Hall on the Fourth of July.

[14] Probably four editions were printed in 1857. (Boston: Office
Boston Daily Bee 60 pp.) Not until November 22, 1864, was Mr. Alger
asked by the City to furnish a copy for publication. He granted the
request, and the first official edition (J. E. Farwell & Co., 1864, 53
pp.) was then issued. It lacks the interesting preface and appendix of
the early editions.

[15] There is another edition. (Boston: Ticknor & Fields, 1859, 69 pp.)
A third (Boston: Rockwell & Churchill, 1882, 46 pp.) omits the dinner
at Faneuil Hall, the correspondence and events of the celebration.

[16] There is a preliminary edition of twelve copies. (J. E. Farwell &
Co., 1863. (7), 71 pp.) It is “the first draft of the author’s address,
turned into larger, legible type, for the sole purpose of rendering
easier its public delivery.” It was done by “the liberality of the
City Authorities,” and is, typographically, the handsomest of these
orations. This resulted in the large-paper 75-page edition, printed
from the same type as the 71-page edition, but modified by the author.
It is printed “by order of the Common Council.” The regular edition is
in 60 pp., octavo size.

type, and also an edition from the press of John Wilson & Son, 1876. 55
pp. 8^o.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
